# Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis

This is the teaching material for a short course (4~5 hours) on Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The course focuses on concepts of Bayesian statistics and fundamental ideas of MCMC. The aimed audience is final-year undergraduate students or first-year graduate students in math/stats/engineering departments. R code snippets are provided for the key parts of Monte Carlo algorithms.


## Outline

The course consists of two parts: the first part introduces basic Bayesian inference and the second part MCMC algorithms. In the end, we discuss  Bayesian inference in state space models in finance for a comprehenstive application of conjugate priors, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and Gibbs sampler.

1. What and why?
2. One-parameter models
    + Binomial model
    + Poisson model
    + Exponential family and conjugate priors
3. Normal model
    + Infer mean with known variance
    + Jointly infer mean and variance
4. Baisc Monte Carlo
    * Monte Carlo integration
    * Random variable generation
5. Markov chain Monte Carlo
    + Slice sampler
    + Metropolis-Hastings algorithms
    + Gibbs sampler
